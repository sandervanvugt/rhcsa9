1.	install httpd and configure it to run on port 82
2.	create user lori with UID 1100 and set her shell to /sbin/nologin
3.	find all files in the /etc directory containing the text "strator" and write a list of the absolute filenames to /tmp/stratorfiles.txt
4.	create a symbolic link with the name /tmp/hosts, pointing to /etc/hosts
5.	create a group sales, and a shared group directory /data/sales. Ensure that all new files in this directory are group-owned by the group sales
6.	create an LVM volume with the name lvlab and a size of 50 extents. If necessary, grow an existing volume group to do so, or add a new storage device to you system to create the volume group. Format the volume with the XFS filesystem and mount it persistently on the directory /lvlab. Ensure that no executable files can be started from this volume. If you succeed in making the persistent mount without using /etc/fstab, you will get 10 bonus points. 
7.	set the recommended tuned profile for your system
